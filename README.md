# Age and Gender Classification Project

A deep learning and computer vision project designed to classify images by gender and predict age using UTK face dataset.

## How to Use

1. The core module for predictions is provided in the file `age_and_gender_detection.ipynb`.
2. To make predictions, place your image in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook files.
3. Open `prediction.ipynb`, and pass the path of your image to the `predict_img` function to get the results.
